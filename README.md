# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# NYX-MOVIES
Final Project for TTS

## Summary
This app was created using all the necessary programs and/or 
functions that was learn within 16 weeks under TTS program. In this final project 
I created a movie app, which is super easy/user-friendly for any age to engage on.
Simply sign in to register, once logged in, an Avatar will appear, type in your a movie, and
you can also put your favorite movies in the favorite section. The best part is it is a responsive type
of app which will display really well on all types of devices.


### Software used:
 Visual Studio Code/React

### What I learn:
I learned how to make a functioning app

#### Challenges to improve on:
1. What components to use
2. Remembering to import


#### Random Unexpected Challenges:
1. Movies stayed verticle when it was suppose to be across/side by side

#### Solutions/solving the issue:
 Bootstrap in package.json helped with making it responsive


#### Weakness so far:
1.	Components and states
